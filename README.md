# Minimal pen plotter template

## About

This is a bare-bones template for creating generative art for pen plotters, based on [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

I used this template when I first started creating art for the AxiDraw plotter. I now use a heavier TS-based framework with a bundler in order to reuse "library" code between my sketches, but this minimal template works great for anyone starting out.

## Usage

Run a static server, like this Python-based one:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
